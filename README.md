# Traditional-Dimenionality-reduction-techniques-for-data-visualization

### *Draft for me*

Traditional techniques for dimensionality reduction are methods used to reduce the number of input variables (or features) in a dataset while preserving as much information as possible. Here are some of the most commonly used traditional techniques:

---

### 1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Type**: Linear
- **Description**: Transforms data into a new coordinate system such that the greatest variance lies on the first axis (principal component), the second greatest on the second axis, and so on.
- **Use Case**: When features are correlated and you want to reduce redundancy.

---

### 2. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
- **Type**: Supervised, linear
- **Description**: Projects data in a way that maximizes class separability. It tries to maximize the ratio of between-class variance to the within-class variance.
- **Use Case**: When you have labeled data and want to preserve class-discriminatory information.

---

### 3. **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**
- **Type**: Non-linear
- **Description**: Focuses on preserving local structure and visualizing high-dimensional data in 2 or 3 dimensions.
- **Use Case**: Data visualization, especially with clustering or manifolds.

---

### 4. **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)**
- **Type**: Non-linear
- **Description**: Preserves the pairwise distances between data points in the reduced space.
- **Use Case**: Useful when distance between points is meaningful (e.g., similarity or dissimilarity matrices).

---

### 5. **Isomap**
- **Type**: Non-linear
- **Description**: Extends MDS by preserving geodesic distances on a manifold rather than direct Euclidean distances.
- **Use Case**: When the data lies on a non-linear manifold (e.g., Swiss roll).

---

### 6. **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**
- **Type**: Linear
- **Description**: Assumes that the observed data are mixtures of statistically independent components and tries to separate them.
- **Use Case**: Signal processing (e.g., separating voices from background noise).

---

### 7. **Autoencoders** (Though these are neural-based, they're often considered when comparing dimensionality reduction)
- **Type**: Non-linear, unsupervised
- **Description**: Neural networks trained to reproduce the input at the output via a compressed latent representation.
- **Use Case**: Complex, non-linear feature reduction, especially in deep learning contexts.

# Evaluating and Comparing Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

Evaluating dimensionality reduction techniques requires considering multiple factors since each method has different strengths, weaknesses, and assumptions. Here's a comprehensive framework for evaluation and comparison:

## Evaluation Metrics

### 1. **Information Preservation**
- **Explained Variance Ratio** (for PCA, LDA): Percentage of variance retained after reduction
- **Reconstruction Error**: Difference between original and reconstructed data (especially for autoencoders)
- **Cophenetic Correlation**: Measures how well the pairwise distances are preserved

### 2. **Structural Preservation**
- **Trustworthiness and Continuity**: Measures whether points that are close in the original space remain close in the reduced space
- **Neighborhood Preservation**: Percentage of k-nearest neighbors preserved after reduction

### 3. **Discriminative Power** (for supervised contexts)
- **Classification Accuracy**: Train a classifier on reduced features and evaluate performance
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures how well clusters are separated

### 4. **Computational Efficiency**
- **Training Time**: Time required to fit the model
- **Transformation Time**: Time required to transform new data
- **Memory Usage**: RAM required during computation

## Comparison Framework

### 1. **Data Characteristics**
- **Linearity**: PCA and LDA assume linear relationships; t-SNE, Isomap better for non-linear data
- **Dimensionality**: Some methods (like t-SNE) don't scale well to very high dimensions
- **Sample Size**: Methods like Isomap require sufficient samples to estimate the manifold
- **Noise Sensitivity**: How robust is each method to noisy features?

### 2. **Task Requirements**
- **Visualization vs. Feature Extraction**: t-SNE excels at visualization but isn't ideal for feature extraction
- **Interpretability**: PCA components have clear interpretations; t-SNE embeddings don't
- **Invertibility**: Can you reconstruct the original data? (PCA, autoencoders: yes; t-SNE: no)
- **Out-of-sample Extension**: Can new data points be projected? (Difficult for t-SNE, easy for PCA)

### 3. **Practical Considerations**
- **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: t-SNE requires careful tuning; PCA has fewer parameters
- **Determinism**: PCA is deterministic; t-SNE has random initializations
- **Scalability**: How well does the method handle large datasets?

## Method-Specific Evaluation

### PCA
- Evaluate using explained variance ratio
- Check if linear assumptions hold using scree plots
- Test for multicollinearity in original features

### LDA
- Evaluate using classification accuracy post-reduction
- Check class separation in reduced space
- Verify assumptions (normal distribution, equal covariance matrices)

### t-SNE
- Evaluate perplexity parameter's impact
- Check for "false" clusters (common t-SNE artifact)
- Assess stability across multiple runs

### MDS
- Compare stress values (goodness of fit)
- Evaluate preservation of large vs. small distances

### Isomap
- Test sensitivity to neighborhood size parameter
- Evaluate geodesic distance approximation quality

### ICA
- Assess statistical independence of components
- Evaluate kurtosis of extracted components

### Autoencoders
- Compare reconstruction loss across architectures
- Evaluate latent space organization
- Test generalization to new data

## Practical Approach to Comparison

1. **Split your evaluation**: Train on one subset, evaluate on another
2. **Use multiple metrics**: No single metric captures all aspects
3. **Visualize results**: Plot reduced dimensions to gain intuition
4. **Cross-validation**: Ensure results are consistent across data splits
5. **Downstream task performance**: Ultimate test is how well the reduced features perform in your actual application
